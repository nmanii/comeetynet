Hello to all,

We hope you are all in good shape and staying strong.

It is with great sadness that we inform you of **the end of the comeety.net platform**.

Our goal has always been to promote and make easy meeting people from all around the world, through intercultural activities, outings...
But, unfortunately **the pandemic came and the opportunities to meet became, and still are, very limited**.

To top if off, **OVH servers**, where our website was hosted, **recently caught fire which rushed the complete stop of comeety.net.**

**But it's not over yet!**

Comeety is not just a website. It's about meeting people, sharing experiences, international friendships and a desire to interact and bond with open-minded people.
So let us keep in touch and get together through the [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/comeety/) or the [group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1736528936669241). And soon, we all hope, we will be able to meet again in-person.

Please contact us if you want to create a Comeety group in your city and we will make available the link with the main page.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank, once again, all those who have helped bring the website alive and share an amazing and meaningful experience during these past 5 years.

**Thank you all and the adventure continues!**

The comeeteam
